There's a translation activity at the end of the worksheet, that I suggest the teacher to ask as homework.
Maybe, depending on the level of each student, they might need some help in reading, pronouncing some words and answering to the questions.
Help your students out while they work with it!
Remember:it is always good to avoid using any worksheet before teaching all the subjects that are contemplated by it. It can demotivate your kids.
I hope you all enjoy working with it! zxc
